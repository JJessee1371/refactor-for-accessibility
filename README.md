# refactor-for-accessibility

Link to the live site: [Code Refactor](https://jjessee1371.github.io/refactor-for-accessibility/)

Purpose: The intent behind this project was to refactor exisitng code and ensure that the
website was accessible to all users while improving the readability of the code for future developers. In order to accomplish the goal of improving readability for developers I utilized semantic HTML to define sections of the page, consolidated duplciate CSS properties, and included comments defining the function of sections of code. To enhance the user experience, alt tags were included on the exisitng images, color schemes were altered for improved visibility, and the anchor tags were corrected to achieve functioning page navigation.
